  <div class="col-lg-3 col-md-5 col-sm-12" > <p class = "header">Sushi</p> <p>  It is especially important to submit this assignment before the deadline, May 22, 11:59 PM PDT, because it must be graded by others. If you submit late, there may not be enough classmates around to review your work. This makes it difficult - and in some cases, impossible - to produce a grade. Submit on time to avoid these risks.</p> </div>
